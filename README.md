## Production Optimization Project
This project focuses on solving a linear programming problem to maximize profit from producing five different products under given resource constraints. The optimization problem considers various constraints such as labor, machine time, raw materials, maximum production limits, and minimum production requirements.

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to maximize the total profit from the production of five products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5) by optimizing their production quantities within given resource constraints. The constraints include limits on labor, machine time, raw materials, and specific production requirements for certain products.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/production_optimization.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd production_optimization
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the optimization and solve the linear programming problem, execute the following command:

```sh
python optimization.py
```

The script will display the status of the solution, optimal production quantities for each product, total profit, and resource utilization.

## Files
- optimization.py: Contains the code to define and solve the linear programming problem.
- test_optimization.py: Includes test cases to validate the optimization logic.
- docs/: Directory containing the user guide and additional documentation.
- requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
